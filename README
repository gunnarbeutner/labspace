LabSpace
========

This is an implementation of the 'Mafia' game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) for sbnc.

In order to use it you will need to load the script in your sbnc.tcl config file:

	setctx "<yourbot>"
	source scripts/labspace.tcl

The script can be used in any of the channels your bot is in (even simultaneously). It supports the following channel commands:

!add - joins the lobby
!remove - leaves the lobby

Leaving channels will also automatically remove you from any running games.

Once there are enough players in the lobby the game will automatically start (with a short delay to allow more players to join).

At the start of the game the bot randomly assigns a role to each player. The following roles are available:

scientist: The mad scientists' goal is to eliminate all the other players.
investigator: The investigator has a chance to reveal another player's role (once per round).
citizen: No special abilities. Everyone gets to vote on who to lynch at the end of the round though.
